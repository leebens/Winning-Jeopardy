Let's say you want to compete on Jeopardy, and you're looking for any edge you can get to win. In this project, I'll work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help you win.\n",

    "    - Use the apply method to make the code that calculates frequencies more efficient.\n",
